    title: 'Inch',
    description: 'Working for the Biomedical Interferometry Optical and Spectroscopy Lab at Duke, I have been tasked with transforming a novel quantitative phase imaging system into a low-cost diagnostic tool using my expertise in opto-mechanical design. This technology aims to enhance the visualization of sickle cell disease morphology, to enable high-throughput diagnostics in low-resource healthcare settings. One of the greatest engineering challenges lies in preserving optical stability and functionality while adapting the system for low-cost commercialization.',

    title: 'MII-OCT',
    description: 'As part of my senior design project in the Optical Neural Imaging Lab at UC Riverside, I built a system that integrates optical coherence tomography (OCT) with an upright brightfield microscope to enable multimodal imaging of tissue samples. Alongside my team, I worked through the entire design process of identifying user needs and engineering constraints, researching imaging systems, prototyping optomechanical components, assembling a stable device, and validating optical functions. The project culminated in a functional and impactful medical device that enabled simultaneous brightfield and OCT imaging, which we presented at the UCR Senior Design showcase.',

    title: 'Tissue Injury and Mortality Engineering Lab',
    description: 'As an undergraduate researcher at UC Riverside, I investigated the stress tolerance of stem cells with the goal of engineering a more resistant stem-cell therapy. To understand the stress mechanisms of genetically modified stem cells, I utilized confocal imaging and MATLAB simulation models to quantify the localization of Wnt signal pathway transcription cofactors. I also led independent experiments quantifying the toxic responses of genetically modified ASCs to environmental toxins, which I presented at UC Riverside\'s Undergraduate Symposium. This work combined computational modeling with hands-on experimentation to disseminate research findings and contribute to a deeper understanding within regenerative medicine.',

    title: 'Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation',
    description: 'Through this internship, I engaged in high-level research assessing the applications of organoids and micro-organospheres in precision medicine and oncology research, all while gaining perspective into the innovation process of translational research. During my 12-week internship, I engaged in several projects with vast clinical and entrepreneurial implications. These experiments included conducting high-throughput characterization of IPSC-derived hepatocyte organoids, identifying the most physiologically relevant 3-D extracellular environments for drug delivery in micro-organoids, and creating drug assays that utilize patient-derived microtumors.   My work culminated in a final presentation in which I discussed my research on novel disease modeling and cell-based diagnostic applications of organoid technologies.',
